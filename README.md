# Completion Report: Project Details and Tech Stack

1. How to start the project

I chose a simple approach for the sake of speed and set up the project using Create React App.
In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

2. Potential for improvement

- add Validation on input
- use css preprocessor for better css organization
- move all states, useEffects from App to useContenxt as I did with isMobile, to make code cleaner without prop-drilling
- use TypeScript to provide type safety and early error detection
- cover components with Unit tests to provide early bug detection
- enhance some interface features, for example, moving the list creation/editing to a separate screen, similar to how task creation/editing are handled on mobile resolutions

3. Figma prototypes
